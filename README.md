#CLIP-PyL

This is the ALPHA version of the CLIP-PyL package, which contains scripts that can parse "crosslink signatures" from aligned CLIP-seq data. The acronym "CLIP" refers to CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation, which is a set of methods that involve preparing and purifying crosslinked RiboNucleoProtein complexes (RNP). The abbreviation "seq" refers to deep sequencing, which is employed to identify and quantify bound RNA fragments. This CLIP-PyL software was written to analyze CLIP-seq datasets. The package is written in Python3 and it can produce maps of CLIP-seq read "pile-ups" (hence the name, CLIP-PyL). In bionformatician's parlance, the term "pile-up" refers to "piles" of aligned reads. These read "piles" are also referred to as "read clusters" or "read peaks". They are comprised of reads that align to a region of the genome (or transcriptome) in an overlapping manner.

The CLIP-PyL package has a command line interface (CLI). The CLI can be invoked by scripts that are contained within the scripts folder.

Currently, HITS-CLIP is the only CLIP-seq method variant that is supported. However, support for PAR-CLIP and iCLIP data will be released if considerable interest arises.

#General Usage

The user MUST pre-process the "raw" HITS-CLIP reads by clipping the adapter sequences. I typically use the FASTQ/A Clipper tool from the [FASTX toolkit](hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) for this task. However, other suitable options exist. The user must also align the preprocessed reads to a reference genome assembly. Currently, single-end read alignments generated by the [bwa](bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml) fast read alignment software are supported. Finally, the user must use the [SAMTools software](http://www.htslib.org/) to generate indexed bam files. CLIP-PyL takes the indexed bam files and returns a set of [bedgraph](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1.8) files including normalized coverage, fragment termini (an indicator of protected fragment boundaries), and crosslink-induced mutation rates. The bedgraph files can be viewed with most genome browser tools (e.g. [Broad's Integrated Genome Viewer](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) or [UCSC's Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/)).

The CLIP-PyL package also contains utilities to produce pdf files containing coverage map graphics for sets of genome intervals, which are specified by the user in a [bed file format](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1). Notably, cis-element regions can be included in the coverage graphics if the user supplies additional bed files specifying the locations of these elements. CLIP-PyL utilizies the third-party graphical back-end known as [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) to generate these coverage graphics.

#Dependencies

* python >= 3.2 https://www.python.org/

* pysam https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysam

* matplotlib http://matplotlib.org/

If you have multiple python versions installed on your machine then please be certain to install the pysam and matplotlib packages into your python3 environment.

#Installation

Download the most recent version of the package at [https://github.com/lb3/CLIP-PyL](https://github.com/lb3/CLIP-PyL). You can use git to clone the master branch or use the "Download ZIP" button on the right side of the CLIP-PyL github page.

#Testing the installation with sample data

CLIP-PyL ships with sample data. The sample data is comprised of a Stem Loop Binding Protein (SLBP) HITS-CLIP dataset. Note that only a subset of the data set is provided to save storage space. To install CLIP-PyL, simply add the package to your python3 namespace by adding  You can test your installation against the sample data by issuing the following commands:

    #!/bin/bash
    # 1. change your current working directory to the directory where you 
    #    downloaded or cloned the CLIP-PyL package
    cd foo/bar/source-download-directory/
    # 2. run the set of basic tests
    python3 unitest clippyl

If the test runs to completion then you should find a file named CLIP-PyL_graphics_test.pdf in your present working directory. This file contains coverage graphics for each of the replication-depenent histone genes, calculated from the SLBP HITS-CLIP data.

#Using the clippyl-graphics script to draw CLIP-seq peaks across user-specified genomic intervals

You may generate your own HITS-CLIP graphics file by providing a set of adapter-trimmed HITS-CLIP alignment files in bam format. Note that the corresponding bam index file (bai) should also be present in the same directory as your bam files. Also, you must provide a bed file that specifies the genomics intervals where the graphics will be calculated. Finally, be sure to provide the number of mapped reads for each input bam. Alternatively, you may invoke use the auto-norm parameter and clippyl will calculate the number of mapped reads from your input bam file(s) for use as the normalization factor(s). For example, here is how one would generate clippyl graphics using sample data from the clippyl package

    #!/bin/bash
    BAM_FILE_DIR="clippyl/sample_data/HITS-CLIP_SLBP_histone_mRNA_01/bwa_samse_hg19"
    BED_FILE="clippyl/sample_data/genomic_interval_queries/RD_Histone_Genes.bed"
    
    clippyl-graphics -i $BAM_FILE_DIR/SLBP_CLIP_high_MW_high_MNase.HISTONLY.discardUnclipped.bam \
                        $BAM_FILE_DIR/SLBP_CLIP_high_MW_low_MNase.HISTONLY.discardUnclipped.bam \
