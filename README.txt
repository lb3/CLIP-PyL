clipPyL
========

clipPyL can parse "crosslink signatures" from HITS-CLIP, PAR-CLIP or iCLIP
data. The CLIP-PyL tools take and indexed .bam file and dumps the crosslink
signatures to .bed files, which are compatible with most genome browser tools
(e.g. Broad's Integrated Genome Viewer or UCSC's Genome Browser). Currently, 
only alignments generated by the BWA-SW algorithm are supported::

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    
    from towelstuff import location
    from towelstuff import utils
    
    if utils.has_towel():
        print "Your towel is located:", location.where_is_my_towel()

The CLIP-PyL package also contains utilities to produce coverage graphics for 
sets of genome intervals that are specified in a .bed file. Cis-element regions
can also be indicated in the output graphics if the user supplies .bed file(s) 
containing the locations of these elements.
