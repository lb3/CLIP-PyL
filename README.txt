CLIP-PyL
========

The CLIP-PyL package contains scripts that can parse "crosslink signatures" 
from aligned CLIP-seq data. HITS-CLIP, PAR-CLIP or iCLIP data. These scripts 
take an indexed bam file as input and returns a set of bedgraph files 
containing crosslink metrics. Note that bedgraph files are compatible with most 
genome browser tools (e.g. Broad's Integrated Genome Viewer or UCSC's Genome 
Browser). Currently, only alignments generated by the BWA-SW algorithm are 
supported::

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    
    from towelstuff import location
    from towelstuff import utils
    
    if utils.has_towel():
        print "Your towel is located:", location.where_is_my_towel()

The CLIP-PyL package also contains utilities to produce coverage graphics for 
sets of genome intervals that are specified in a bed file. Cis-element regions
can also be indicated in the output graphics if the user supplies additional 
bed files containing the locations of these elements.
