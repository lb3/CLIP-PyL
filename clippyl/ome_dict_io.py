class OmeDict():
    """
    An dictionary-based storage structure for "omics" data (hence "OmeDict").
    The supported input object type is the SiteTuple, which is a namedtuple
    with the following fields:
    reference, start, end, strand, dataobject
    
    The reference field is most often populated by a chromosome name but, 
    alternatively, a transcript name or some other reference type is also valid.
    The start and end fields are coordinates along the reference. The 
    coordinates must be "UCSC-style" (right-open zero based; (start, end]). Note
    that the supported object type for the data field is integer and that the 
    addition operator is used to add data.
    
    Add data to the OmeDict using the add_site_tuple method.
    
    Also, note that an OrderedDict is used to store the references as well as
    the coordinate keys for each reference. This makes retrieving data from the
    OmeDict more convinient; key input order is preserved, which obviates the
    need to sort downstream.
